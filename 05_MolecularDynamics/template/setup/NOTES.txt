This file contains information on setting up the simulation directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All that needs to be done is to run the script "run_prep.sh" from this 
directory. Before running this script, the following was already done: 

   Prepare an input file for the preparation program (uiowa_goprep.16-06-12.exe)

   The input file is:
     2b3p.inp
   Most of the parameters are straightforward, but here are some important points:
     - rhydro1: For the C-alpha models, this should be set to 5.3 angstroms. For
       the side-chain model, this should be set to 3.5 angstroms. See Adrian 
       Elcock's paper: dio:10.1021/ct800499p. This reproduces translational and
       rotational diffusion coefficients for a variety of proteins, as compared
       to the program Hydropro. 

   num_first_type: specifies the molecule number.

   pH:  I believe this is only used in determining charges.

   Set the go distance cutoff to 5.5 angstroms.  This means that any pair of
     residues with atoms that are closer than 5.5 angstroms counts as a go
     pair (native contact).

   epsilon, edihed1_ca, and edihed2_ca: These are the well depth for the
     favorable Go-potential that applies to native contacts (the 12-10 potential),
     and the "V1" and "V3" pseudo-dihedral barrier heights.  These terms can vary,
     but should stay in the ratio of 12:10:5 for c-alpha models, and 25:41:21 for 
     side-chain models.  These sets of parameters were used in Dr. Elcock's paper,
     "Striking effects of diffusion...".

   coarse/fine:  Here we use the coarse model, which includes one "bead" at the 
     c-alpha position of each residue.

   edihed1_sc and edihed2_sc are for the side chain model, which we are not using.

   kbond and kangle: force constants for bond and angle terms.  These are usually
     set to 20 kcal/angstrom/mol and 10 kcal/radian/mol, respectively.

Here is some information on what the script "run_prep.sh" does:

1. Download the PDB file from www.rcsb.org.  We use PDB code 2b3p.

2. Run the prep program, and rename the files.
